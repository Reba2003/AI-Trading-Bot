# AI-Trading-Bot
I built a Python-based AI trading bot featuring a custom user interface and automated execution.

# About the bot
The project utilizes the Tkinter library to build a dashboard where users can manage equity positions, set position sizes, and monitor a Martingale DCA strategy. By integrating the Alpaca API, the bot establishes a live connection to brokerage services for real-time data fetching and order placement.A sophisticated Large Language Model (LLM) component is incorporated to serve as an AI portfolio manager, providing risk exposure analysis and strategic insights. The system also includes a persistent data storage feature using JSON files to save and load user configurations between sessions.
